# AI-ML-Foundation
This repository represents the basic and fundamentals to advanced concepts of AI and ML. It covers a wide range of topics including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and deployment using popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## Managing Multiple Project Folders in a Single Git Repository (One Branch per Folder using Worktrees)

This repository contains multiple independent project folders.
Each folder is tied to its **own Git branch**, using [Git Worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree). This keeps the remote branches clean while letting you organize your local machine with separate folders.

### üìÅ Structure Example

```
AI-ML/                    ‚Üê Main repo
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Python For ML/         ‚Üê Local folder for 'python-for-ml' branch
‚îú‚îÄ Data Engineering/      ‚Üê Local folder for 'data-engineering' branch
‚îî‚îÄ README.md              ‚Üê Lives only in the main branch
```

On GitHub:

* The `python-for-ml` branch only contains the contents of `Python For ML/`
* The `data-engineering` branch only contains the contents of `Data Engineering/`
* The `main` branch does **not** contain these folders (they're in `.gitignore` locally)

---

### üß≠ Why Worktrees?

Normally, you‚Äôd have to **checkout different branches in the same folder** to work on multiple projects ‚Äî messy and slow.
Worktrees let you check out **multiple branches at once** into separate folders, while all staying in the same repo.

---

### üõ† How to Add a New Project Folder

Suppose you want to add a new project called `Python For ML` in its own folder and branch:

1. **Create a new branch**

   ```bash
   git branch python-for-ml
   ```

2. **Add a worktree** linked to that branch

   ```bash
   git worktree add "./Python For ML" python-for-ml
   ```

3. **Go inside the new folder** and work as usual

   ```bash
   cd "Python For ML"
   # Add files, initialize code, etc.
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initialize Python For ML project"
   git push origin python-for-ml
   ```

4. **Ignore the folder on the main branch** so it doesn‚Äôt pollute main:
   Edit `.gitignore` on `main`:

   ```
   /Python For ML
   ```

   Then commit and push:

   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Ignore Python For ML folder in main"
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### üåø Adding More Worktrees

Repeat the above for every new project folder:

```bash
git branch new-project
git worktree add "./New-Project" new-project
```

---
---

### üåø Committing From main Branch and Remove worktree gitlink for The Folder

1. Add the folder to .gitignore on main(if not done already)

Open .gitignore in the root of your repo (on the main branch) and add:

```bash
/Python For ML
```


Save it, then commit:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore 'Python For ML' folder on main"
git push origin main
```

2. Remove the accidentally tracked folder reference(if already committed)

The ‚Äú‚Üí‚Äù icon you saw on GitHub main means the folder got committed as a gitlink. To remove that cleanly:

```bash
git rm -r --cached "Python For ML"
```

Notice the quotes ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential because of the spaces.

Then commit and push:

```bash
git commit -m "Remove worktree gitlink for 'Python For ML' from main"
git push origin main
```

3. Verify

You can check locally:

```bash
git ls-tree main
```

The entry for Python For ML should be gone.

And on GitHub, refresh the main branch ‚Äî that folder with the right arrow should disappear. Only your actual root files (e.g., README.md) should remain.

---

### üìã Useful Commands

List all worktrees:

```bash
git worktree list
```

Remove a worktree:

```bash
git worktree remove "./Data-Engineering"
```

Detach a branch but keep files:

```bash
git worktree remove --force "./Data-Engineering"
```

---

### üìù Notes

* Each folder is **independent**. Commits inside one don‚Äôt affect the others.
* Push and pull inside each project folder as if it were its own repo.
* The root `README.md` stays in `main` and can document the overall structure.

---

This approach is ideal if you want **one repo** but **clean, isolated project branches**, without juggling multiple local clones.
