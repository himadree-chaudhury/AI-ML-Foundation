When a method in a subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in its superclass, the method in the subclass overrides the one in the superclass. This allows for dynamic polymorphism, where the appropriate method is called based on the object's runtime type. This is useful for providing specific behavior in subclasses while maintaining a common interface defined in the superclass.\n",
